/* FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
Functional programming is a style of programming
based not on objects and methods, but on small,
generic, and reusable "pure" functions. A pure
function has these properties:
- they operate only on their inputs, and make no 
    reference to other data (e.g., variables at a 
    higher scope)
- they never modify their inputsâ€”instead, they 
    always return new data or a reference to
    unmodified inputs
- they have no side effects outside of their outputs 
    (e.g., they never modify variables at a higher scope)
- because of these previous rules, they always return 
    the same outputs for the same inputs

Functional programming is possible in languages
like JavaScript that treat functions as values.
We can pass functions to other functions as
parameters, and even return functions from other
functions as the function's return value.

/* THE DATA
The babynames_2016.js file defines one global
variable named BABYNAMES, which is set to an
array containing 32,868 objects. Each object
is a record reporting how many babies were
registered with the Social Security Administration
in 2016 with a particular name and biological sex.

Each object has the same 3 properties:
 - name: a first name
 - sex: the biological sex reported to the SSA
 - count: the number of babies registered with
          the SSA with that name and sex.
*/
console.log("there are %s records in the BABYNAMES array", 
    numeral(BABYNAMES.length).format("0,0"));

/* FILTERING
Every array has a .filter() method which takes a
predicate function as the first parameter. The 
.filter() function returns a new array containing
only those elements for which the predicate function
returned a truthy value
*/

//TODO: create predicate functions that we can
//use to filter the BABYNAMES array based on the
//value in the `sex` property of each object in
//the array





/* SORTING
Every array also has a .sort() method, which takes
a comparator function as the first parameter.
The comparator function is passed two elements
at a time, and must return a negative number if
the first element is less than the second, 
a zero if they are equal to each other, or
a positive number if the first is greater than
the second.
*/

//TODO: create comparator functions we can use
//to sort the BABYNAMES array based on count
//and name



//TODO: create a descending() function that
//wraps a comparator function to perform a
//descending sort instead of an ascending sort



/* SLICING 
Every array has a .slice() method, which returns
a new array containing only a segment of the elements.
You provide the starting index, and the index to go
up to but not include.
*/

//TODO: use .slice() to get the top 10 female baby 
//name records


/* MAPPING
Every arrays also has a .map() method, which
accepts a transformer function. The .map() method
returns a new array of the same length as the source
array. It passes each element from the source array
into your transformer function as the first parameter.
Whatever you transformer function returns is put into
the output array.
*/

//TODO: use .map() to transform the top 10 female
//baby name records array into an array of strings
//containing just the names themselves


//TODO: use .map() to transform those top 10
//names into all lower case



/* REDUCING
Every array also has a .reduce() method, which
allows you to reduce an array of elements down
to a single value. For example, you can reduce
an array of numbers down to their sum, or down
to the maximum value in the array.

//key already. If not, add it to the object with
//an associate value of 0. Then increment the value
