/*
    Introduction to JavaScript
    We will use this script to learn the fundamentals
    of the JavaScript language, which you can use in
    many contexts including a web browser.
    Open index.html and open the Developer Tools Console 
    to see output.

    JavaScript is an interpreted scripting language,
    so execution starts at the top of this script and
    continues downward to the end. There is no main
    entry point function/method.

    The @ts-check comment immediately following this
    block comment will turn on simple type-checking
    in Visual Studio Code. It has no effect on how
    this script executes at runtime in the browser
    and will be ignored by all other editors. But if
    you are using vscode, it will help catch some
    common errors while you are coding.
    See https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Type-Checking-JavaScript-Files
*/
// @ts-check

//this statement switches the JavaScript interpreter
//into strict mode, which disables/prohibits several
//things you used to be able to do that generally
//led to more problems than benefits. This affects
//how the strict is interpreted by the browser at runtime.
//see https://drstearns.github.io/tutorials/javascript/#secstrictmode
"use strict";


/* VARIABLES

One major difference between JavaScript and Java
is that all variables are dynamically-typed. 
When you declare a variable, you don't specify
the data type, and you can assign a value of any
type to the variable at any time. Of course, it
is good practice to treat a variable as having
a single type, and only assign values of that 
type to that variable. The @ts-check above will
show an error if you switch types during a
variable's lifetime.

The primitive data types include:
- string
- number
- boolean
- `undefined` and `null`
*/

//TODO: declare a new variable named `x`
//and initialize it to a literal string
let x = 'this is literally a string';

//the `console` object represents the developer
//tools console, or the terminal if you run this
//under Node.js. The `.log()` method writes the 
//value of an expression to the console.
//TODO: write `x` to the console
console.log('var x = ' + x);

//if you don't initialize a new variable
//it's value is `undefined`
let uninitializedVariable;
console.log("uninitializedVariable is:", uninitializedVariable);


//variables declared with `let` have block scope
//similar to other languages like Java
//but variables declared with `var` are
//"hoisted" to function scope
var temp = 5;
if (temp > 0) {
    var temp = 1;
    temp++;
}
//what do you think the value of `temp` is after the if block?
//use console.log() to find out!
console.log('temp = ', temp);

let temp2 = 5;
if (temp2 > 0) {
    let temp2 = 1;
    temp2++;
}
//what do you think the value of `temp2` is after the if block?
//use console.log() to find out!
console.log('temp2 = ' + temp2);

//moral of the story: use `let` instead of `var`


/* ARRAYS

JavaScript has built-in support for arrays,
which are ordered collections of elements
that can be accessed randomly. Literal
array values are a comma-delimited list of
values surrounded by [ ]. 
To create a zero-length array, just use `[]`.
*/
//TODO: declare a variable named `emptyArray`
//and set it equal to an empty array
let emptyArray = [];

//TODO: declare a variable named `nums`
//and set it equal to an array of numbers
//containing 10,11,12,13,14
let nums = [10,11,12,13,14];


//the `.length` property returns 
//the number of elements in the array
//TODO: write the length of `nums` to the console
console.log(nums.length);

//you can add elements to the end of an array 
//using the build-in .push() method
//TODO: add the number 15 to the end of the `nums` array
nums.push(15);
console.log(nums);

//TODO: create a new variable named `courses`
//that is initialized to an array of strings,
//one for each course name you are currently 
//taking (e.g., "INFO 343"), 
//and write that to the console
let courses = ["INFO 343", "INFO 431", "INFO 495"];

//TODO: write the last element in the array to the console
console.log(courses[courses.length-1]);

/* FOR LOOPS
For loops work exactly like they do in Java,
only you don't give the iterator variable a data type
*/
console.group("for loop example")
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log("loop iterator is:", i);
}
console.groupEnd();

/* TODO: create a new zero-length
array, and use a for() loop to populate
the array with all the *even* numbers
between 0 and 49. Write the populated
array to the console to make sure you
did it right.
*/
let evenNum = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 50; i+=2) {
        evenNum.push(i);
}
console.log(evenNum);
/* OBJECTS

JavaScript also has built-in support for
"objects" which are really just hash-table 
maps. A map stores a collection of 
key and value pairs, kind of like a
dictionary stores words and definitions.
Keys must be strings, but values can be
of any data type, including arrays or
other objects.

Literal objects are a comma-delimited
list of `key: value` pairs, surrounded
by { }. To create an empty object, just
use `{}`.
*/

//TODO: declare a new variable named `emptyObject`
//and set it equal to an empty object
let emptyObject = {};

//TODO: declare a new variable named `player`
//and set it to an object with the following properties:
// firstName = "Mary"
// lastName = "Rodriguez"
// totalPoints = 4
// level = 0
let player  = {
    firstName: "Benny",
    nickName: "The Jet",
    lastName: "Rodriguez",
    totalPoints: 4,
    level: 0
}


//you can get the value for a key using
//the familiar `.` syntax
//TODO: write the firstName and lastName properties to the console
console.log(player.nickName);

//you can also get the value for a key
//using an array-like syntax, which can
//accept an expression
//TODO: get the lastName property using the 
//array-like syntax, using a variable set to "lastName"
//as the expression
let y = "lastName";
console.log(player[y]);

//these key/value pairs are often called "properties"
//because the syntax looks a lot like property 
//access in Java. But new properties can be added
//or removed at any time.
//TODO: add a new `email` property set to "mary@example.com"
//and write that to the console
player.email = "benny@thejet.com";
console.log(player.firstName, player.email);

//(doesn't exist, so it should just write "undefined", with no error)

/* FUNCTIONS

specify an empty string as the separator, it splits
the string into an array of letters.

Every array has a .join() method, which joins the 
array elements into a string, optionally putting a
separator in between each element. For example, 
["aa","bb","cc"].join(";") returns "aa;bb;cc".
If you specify an empty string as the separator,
it doesn't put anything in between the elements.

/* CONDITIONALS and TRUTHINESS 

JavaScript has two different equality operators:
== and ===. The former will coerce the values on
either side to a common data type if necessary and
then compare them. The latter always returns false

*/


//JavaScript will also coerce non-Boolean values used in
//boolean expressions to true/false, using these rules:
// - 0, "", undefined, null, and NaN (not a number) coerce to `false`
// - everything else coerces to `true`


//this coercion happens only when evaluating the boolean
//expression, so you can use this to do some neat tricks:
//default a value using short-circuiting || expression


//JavaScript also has a ternary operator that is like
//an if/else statement all in one operator:
/**

 * @param {number} n1 
 * @param {number} n2 
 * @returns {number}

/* Note that we passed a _reference to_ our compareNums function
to the .sort() method. We didn't _invoke_ that function using ().
Instead we just used the _name_ of the function, which gives us
a reference to the function itself. This reference is a value,
which means we can use it wherever we can use other kinds of values
(strings, numbers, boolean, etc).

One place we can use values is function parameters, so you can pass 
function references to other functions as parameters. That's what we did
with the .sort() method above. This enables a style of programming
known as "functional programming". We will learn more about that during
our next class.
