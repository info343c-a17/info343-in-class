# Essential HTML and CSS

During our first lecture, I will lead you through building a web page from scratch, and adding some styling to it. Along the way, I'll introduce you to several tools that professional web developers use, such as [emmet completions](https://emmet.io/), [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server), and [Adobe Color CC](https://color.adobe.com). We will also discuss some of the best practices that separate the pros from the amateurs.

If you've never built a web page from scratch before, you will have done so by the end of the day!

If you have built several web pages from scratch before, this will be a good refresher, and you might learn a few new tips and tricks.
